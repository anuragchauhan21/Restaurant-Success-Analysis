# Restaurant Success Analysis

## Problem Statement
This project explores whether restaurant success on Yelp, measured through review count and average ratings, is related to user engagement such as reviews, tips, and check ins. 
</br></br>
The goal is to understand how customer interaction patterns relate to restaurant visibility and performance on the platform.

## Research Objectives
- Measure the relationship between user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) and restaurant success metrics (review count and average rating).
- Analyze how sentiment-related signals from reviews and tips (useful, funny, cool reactions) relate to restaurant success.
- Study time-based engagement trends to assess whether consistent activity is linked to long-term restaurant success.

## Hypotheses
- Restaurants with higher user engagement tend to have higher review counts and ratings.
- Positive sentiment and constructive feedback contribute more to restaurant success than neutral or entertainment-driven reactions.
- Consistent engagement over time is a stronger indicator of sustained success than short-term spikes in activity.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the **Yelp Open Dataset**, sourced from [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), focusing on restaurants and associated user engagement signals including reviews, tips, check-ins, and reaction metrics.

## Key Insights
- A small group of **highly active users** contributes a disproportionately **large share of reviews**, playing a major role in restaurant visibility.
- Restaurant engagement is **highest during evening and late-night hours** (5 PM to 1 AM), making this period critical for business performance.
- Review count and engagement reactions such as useful and cool show the **strongest relationship with restaurant success**, while funny reactions have a weaker impact.
- User engagement follows seasonal patterns, with higher activity observed at the beginning and end of the year.
- Engagement increases with restaurant ratings and peaks **around 4.0–4.5 stars**, suggesting that highly rated—but **not necessarily perfect—restaurants** attract the most customer interaction.

## Conclusion
The analysis shows that restaurant success on Yelp is closely tied to how consistently and meaningfully users engage with businesses. Restaurants that attract steady and high quality interaction tend to achieve greater visibility and sustained performance over time.
